This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over vectors and arrays.  The `bug.cpp` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides the corrected version.  Off-by-one errors are subtle but can lead to segmentation faults or unpredictable results.  Carefully review loop conditions when dealing with array/vector indices to avoid this issue.
